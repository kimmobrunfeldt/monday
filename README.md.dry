Monday â€“ *Gathers documentation for you.*
=========================================

![LOGO](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/monday/raw/master/img/mondaysmall.png)

Monday is automatic documentation generator for Python.

**This is a work in progress!**
*projectinfo.py* is currently working but outputs a raw JSON.
Also, decorators, properties and many other Python features are not inspected correctly.
Goal is that the system could automatically generate HTML documentation from the inspected information.

projectinfo.py
--------------

{{ system('python projectinfo.py') | indent(4, true) }}


Inspecting exampleproject package
---------------------------------

Note: All values are casted to str before printing.

```json
{{ system('python projectinfo.py exampleproject') }}```
